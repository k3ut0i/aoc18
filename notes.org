* Notes
** Day 03
If iterating over an array of more than one dimension, *row-major-index* and *row-major-aref* may help by iterating over just one variable.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defparameter a (make-array (list 10 10)))

  (dotimes (x 10)
    (dotimes (y 10)
      (setf (aref a x y) (random 10))))

  (loop :for i :below (array-total-size a)
       :maximizing (row-major-aref a i))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 9

** Day 04
get-max and other related functions could be just inlined, if I used reduce.
If iterating for a single value, just use reduce or find or something similar. Do go all the way to loop for simple iterations.

** Day 05
I should've used char-equal to compare characters ignoring case. That would've improved flow of in both trigger-poly and remove-if(part2).
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (char-equal #\A #\a)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: T
